Vengeance r2 - Quake Engine Source Modification
================================================================================

Introduction by Entar:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vengeance r2 is a Quake engine modification I worked on for a few years, early
on in my learning of programming and graphics technology. Through tinkering
around with this project, I developed my skills significantly in the areas of
OpenGL and C. A number of developers from the online Quake modding community,
including DrLabman and Black (aka BlackHC), contributed heavily to the project.

The project also included a QuakeC and content modification portion which added
new single player and deathmatch levels, altered and improved the game balance
and AI, and added bots (Frikbots) for multiplayer.

Engine Features:

  Enhanced, scriptable Particle System
  GLSL Per-pixel lighting
  Improved file format support including: MD2, MD3, Half-Life BSP, PK3, tga, jpg
  Reflective Water
  Skyboxes
  Light Blooms
  â€¦ and more
